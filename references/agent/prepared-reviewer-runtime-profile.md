# Prepared Reviewer Runtime Profile

This is the technical execution projection inside `ft-test-case-reviewer`. It introduces no new QA policy. The immutable package, context rule card and deterministic gates materialize the applicable canonical reviewer rubric for both `simple-field-property` and `standard-required` scopes.

## Eligibility

Continue only when the payload confirms:

- runner-validated current package metadata, including a non-empty SHA-256 `package_digest`, and immutable draft SHA-256;
- explicit execution/context profiles and unsupported dimensions;
- scope-local source evidence and atomic obligations;
- passed structure, seed, obligation, quality and evidence-access gates;
- semantic-overlap diagnostic and calibration lifecycle.

Return a blocking finding when the payload is insufficient or inconsistent. Do not open full project instructions, package files, production test cases, earlier cycles or full sources to bypass eligibility.

## Review Procedure

1. Review every supplied obligation exactly once and preserve its exact `obligation_id -> atom_id` pair and draft SHA-256.
2. For every testable obligation, verify that its linked TC performs the supplied condition/action with concrete data and reaches the supplied observable oracle.
3. For every gap, unclear or not-applicable obligation, verify that the draft does not invent executable coverage.
4. For every non-blocking constraint gap, verify that the linked TC preserves the `GAP-*` and does not choose an unspecified mechanism.
5. Apply the embedded context rule card: boundary points remain independent; invalid classes remain independent; branch preconditions and integration triggers remain explicit.
6. Reject invented UI, literals, messages, API/DB effects or internal state; validate dictionary claims against projected `active_values`.
7. Reject non-atomic cases, generic fixtures, placeholder steps, source-rule-only expected results, duplicate titles and nominal traceability.
8. Classify every semantic-overlap group. Accept a shared body only when the package explicitly groups one observable multi-obligation check.
9. For UI-calibration candidates, require `ui-calibration-required`, `candidate-ui-calibration`, the linked GAP and a neutral expected result that does not preselect filtering/message/highlight/save behavior.
10. Return exactly the structured review contract requested by the runner. Do not write files.

## Decision Floor

- `accepted` requires every obligation to have a compatible verdict, every testable obligation to be correctly covered, all gaps to be preserved and no error finding.
- `changes-required` requires at least one concrete finding linked to supplied ATOM/TC identifiers, unless it is a set-level scope finding.
- A failed deterministic gate, draft hash mismatch, unknown identifier, lost constraint gap or insufficient evidence prevents sign-off.

## Runtime Boundary

No command is needed. If runtime confirmation is absolutely required, only the explicitly allowlisted environment probe may be used. Any repository exploration or workspace mutation violates the compact prepared reviewer contract.
